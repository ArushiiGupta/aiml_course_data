**Machine Learning-Driven Optimization of Polyester Production in a Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR)**

-> By leveraging advanced Machine Learning algorithms, 
the project aims to optimize the operation of the CSTR 
to achieve the highest possible yield of polyester while maintaining stability and efficiency.

->Considering our problem of optimizing polyester production in a CSTR
with features such as Inlet Flow Rate of Diol , Inlet Flow Rate of
Dicarboxylic Acid , Concentration of Diol (ethylene glycol) , Concentration
of Dicarboxylic Acid (terephthalic acid) , Inlet Temperature , Pressure
Inside Reactor etc several machine learning models could be suitable :-
Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression , Gradient Boosting
Regression , Neural Network Regression.
